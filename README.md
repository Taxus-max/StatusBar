# Status Bar application

It is a simple Electron application created for fun. To see if this task can be solved using Electron

Using this app you should be able to monitor your cpu usage and temperature on your Windows taskbar

**Important** : Always run app as administrator! 

**Known issues**: Temperature reads false value due to problems with windows WMI

# WMI workaround number 2:
>I am using [Open Hardware Monitor](https://openhardwaremonitor.org)'s .dll file directly so there is no need for the 
> software to constantly run in the background.
